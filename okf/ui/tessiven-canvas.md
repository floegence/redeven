# Summary

Tessiven presents one progressively detailed canvas for understanding where
business services run. Solid Runtime node cards sit inside tinted dashed visual
groups; external dependencies use a separate card treatment. Edges are muted
until a related group or object is focused. Wheel zoom and drag pan belong to
the canvas, while object details and DSL editing remain normal selectable text.

# Contract

- Up to 15 Runtime nodes in a group are shown individually. Larger groups use
  a name or ordinal selector and render only the selected node's details.
- Clicking opens object details. Hover tracks related edges without opening
  explanatory UI; right-click, keyboard context menu, and touch context entry
  open Ask Flower with the exact immutable canvas/version selection.
- Layout hints are read from the saved document and applied only to visible
  graph objects; hidden members retain their hints for later expansion.
- Theme tokens, high contrast, product locale, and accessible names are used
  for every card, edge, menu, and action.

# Boundaries

The released Floe graph component owns pan, zoom, routing, layout, focus, and
floating-layer mechanics. Redeven owns the Tessiven projection and business
data. The graph renders the [saved version document](../architecture/tessiven-canvas-contract.md)
without introducing independent topology state. Selecting a node, group, or
historical version cannot change its management permissions. Ask Flower opens
the existing input launcher and never sends a message automatically.
