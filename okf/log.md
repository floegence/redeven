# Redeven OKF Update Log

## 2026-07-17
* **Breaking**: Adopted published Floret v0.10.0 with one Service-owned Store, Floret-owned opaque provider-state persistence, canonical context bootstrap through `ReadThreadContext`, strict typed gateway messages, and a canonical Redeven threadstore v1 that rejects older pre-release schemas.
* **Refactor**: Separated Redeven compaction request identity from Floret operation identity and removed synthetic terminal, identity repair, and commit-compensation paths.
* **Fix**: Documented stable Flower activity rows that gain late presentation payloads without remounting, and removed the obsolete generic Activity renderer path from the maintained UI contract.

## 2026-07-16
* **Refactor**: Made published Floret the single persistent source of truth for tool identity, lifecycle, results, errors, completion output, and Activity projection; removed Redeven tool-state mirrors and bound terminal finalization to the creating Host and explicit settlement target.
* **Update**: Documented model-authored terminal read activity titles, command-focused terminal details, Floret v0.8.0 polling identity exclusions, and removal of the terminal execution timeout alias.
* **Fix**: Documented Floret v0.7.0 running live projections so Flower tool activity is visible before turn completion.
* **Refactor**: Moved Floret projection, stream, activity, event, and availability validation ownership to Floret public validators while retaining only Redeven run identity association and Flower block mapping.

## 2026-07-15
* **Breaking**: Documented Flower live `turn_projection_unavailable` decorations and the strict timeline decoration union shared by bootstrap, history, and replacement snapshots.
* **Breaking**: Advanced Runtime Service compatibility epoch to 7 with matched Desktop and Runtime minimum versions at `v0.9.0`.
* **Update**: Documented published Floret title ownership and typed lifecycle-reason contracts.
* **Update**: Added persistent Flower thread deletion coordination, fixed replay order, restart recovery, and DELETE operation outcomes.
